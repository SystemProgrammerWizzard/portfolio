# Operating Systems Course

Deep dive into operating system concepts, design patterns, and implementation techniques.

## What You'll Learn

Understanding how operating systems work is crucial for system programming. This course covers both theory and practical implementation.

### Core Topics
- **Process Management**: Scheduling, synchronization, and communication
- **Memory Management**: Virtual memory, paging, and segmentation
- **File Systems**: Design patterns and implementation strategies
- **I/O Systems**: Device drivers and interrupt handling
- **Concurrency**: Threads, locks, and synchronization primitives
- **System Calls**: Interface between user space and kernel

### Projects Included
- Implement a simple scheduler
- Build a basic file system
- Create a memory allocator
- Write device drivers and kernel modules
