# How I’d Learn If I Were Starting Over

This isn’t a school, and I’m not here to hand out certificates —  
it’s just my way of organizing what I’ve learned (and am still learning) into a path that makes sense.  
If you’re curious about system programming, maybe this can save you some trial and error.

## Topics I’ve Written About

<div class="courses-grid">

### [🔧 C Programming](/courses/c/)
The building blocks — pointers, memory management, and the low-level stuff that makes systems tick.

### [⚡ C++ Programming](/courses/cpp/)
Modern C++ tricks and techniques — RAII, smart pointers, and ways to write fast, safe code.

### [🦀 Rust Programming](/courses/rust/)
Rust’s safety-first approach — ownership, borrowing, and zero-cost abstractions without the headaches.

### [🐧 Linux & Unix](/courses/linux/)
Peeking under the hood — processes, file systems, and the everyday magic of Linux.

### [🐍 Python for Systems](/courses/python/)
Automating the boring stuff, gluing systems together, and building quick tools with Python.

### [💻 Operating Systems](/courses/os/)
How an OS really works — scheduling, memory, and the patterns that keep everything running.

### [🏗️ Yocto & Embedded](/courses/yocto/)
Rolling your own Linux and tinkering with embedded devices using the Yocto Project.
