# How I Started My Journey with Low-Level Programming

As someone who's always been curious about how things work under the hood, I've recently started exploring the fascinating world of low-level programming. This post is about how I began this journey and what I've learned so far.

## Why Low-Level Programming?

I've always wondered about the magic that happens between typing code and seeing results on the screen. What really happens when you call a function? How does memory management work? These questions led me to start learning about:

- **C Programming**: Understanding pointers, memory allocation, and manual memory management
- **Operating Systems**: Learning about processes, threads, and how the OS manages resources
- **System Calls**: Discovering how programs interact with the operating system
- **Computer Architecture**: Understanding how the CPU, memory, and other components work together

## My Learning Approach

I'm taking this journey step by step:

1. **Starting with C fundamentals** - pointers, arrays, and memory management
2. **Reading classic books** like "The C Programming Language" and "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective"
3. **Practicing with small projects** - simple programs to understand concepts
4. **Documenting everything** - writing about what I learn here on this blog

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning! I plan to explore more topics like:
- Linux system programming
- Understanding how compilers work
- Maybe even kernel programming in the future

This blog will be my space to share what I learn, the challenges I face, and the small victories along the way. Join me on this journey!
