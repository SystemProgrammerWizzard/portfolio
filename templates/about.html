                <h2 class="section-heading">Hey there, I’m Dave 👋</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m an international student in Canada, studying Computer Science and endlessly curious about how computers really work under the hood.
                    I’m the type of person who will happily spend hours poking at something that isn’t even broken — just to figure out <em>why</em> it works.

            <!-- My Philosophy Section -->

                <blockquote class="philosophy-quote">
                    "If you understand the fundamentals, you can survive almost any framework trend."
                </blockquote>
                <p>Here are a few things I try to live by as a developer:</p>
                <ul class="philosophy-list">
                    <li><strong>Depth over breadth</strong> — Master the core concepts that never go out of style.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance matters</strong> — Even if users can’t explain it, they can feel it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Teaching helps you learn</strong> — Explaining pointers to someone else is the ultimate patience test.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open source wins</strong> — More brains, more perspectives, better code (usually).</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- My Journey Section -->
            <div class="about-section">
                <h2 class="section-heading">How I Got Here</h2>
                <p>
                    It all started with one question I’ve had since I was a kid: <em>“But how does it actually work?”</em>  
                    I originally began as a physics student, but over time I realized I wanted to apply what I’d learned in more hands-on ways. That’s when I switched to computer science.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I went from tinkering with Raspberry Pi boards to designing my own PCBs in Eagle — a journey full of curiosity and little victories.  
                    Along the way, I also discovered that sometimes the hardest part isn’t the technology itself, but learning from people who don’t fully understand the concepts either.  
                    This field is, after all, a giant mix of technology and physics rolled into one — and that’s what makes it exciting.

                <p>Life isn’t all semicolons and segmentation faults. Sometimes you’ll find me:</p>
                <ul class="beyond-list">
                    <li>Reading books across different genres.</li>
                    <li>Writing blog posts about tech (and sometimes life).</li>
                    <li>Strolling through the park and people-watching.</li>
                    <li>Playing video games with friends.</li>
                    <li>Exploring new music and occasionally trying to make some myself.</li>
